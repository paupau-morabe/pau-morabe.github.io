	<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:20px">As my College life began,it is a phase to face circumstances in life. I know it is a unique and exciting experience, marked by academic rigor, personal growth, and newfound independence, In our college journey we do meet several people but it will not last in the end,but I am grateful that I was able to meet new friends were no judgements at all. It is okay to cry in pressure than without trying those opportunities.Sleepless nights,exhausted and being depressed in all subject is normal as a collelge student but it is a miles stone of your succes in the end of your journey. As a College student it navigate's a range of opportunities and challenges. I started to feel being independent and join several leadership activity which helps my confidence boost. Despite of ungrateful experience.</p>
