<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:20px">My toddler years began around the age of five, as I began to explore the world around through playing and discovery.It so curious and active, we love to experiment with cause and effect, often making messes in the process.
It was full of fun and excitement experienced. It's also tough and full of adventure. 
We should all cherish our childhood memories as they can always be our companion, our “bliss of solitude.”
Simple things hold grave meaning when they were at our childhood days.
The days were free of complexities and full of innocence. Hence, it is so close to my heart.</p>
