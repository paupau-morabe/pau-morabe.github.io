	<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:20px">As I grew up, I'd always think of my ambition as being good enough to make me known. Aspiring everyone to make their own masterpiece in life that makes a great impact on themselves. It is hard to think about your personal future when you don't have much life experience.There are so many paths and opportunities I could take, but the unpredictable direction I will be heading in tomorrow, what if my mind changes the next day, I can only hope that I can make wise and careful decisions in the future. Everyday is a choice that affects my future. Now that I am able to choose, I am confident that I have a bright future and am on my way to a better life. All I can do now is focus on today and plan for tomorrow. My future depends on me, and I can't wait to see what the future has stores in me.</p>
