<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:20px">I remembered back when I was 6 years old, I was always at my mom's work even though I wasn't permitted to go at her workplace, however my mom didn't want me to be alone. So she carried me all the time when mom goes to work. After my father passed away, my mom decided to look for a job so that she could support me. The tale began when my mother and stepfather were factory coworkers. Years had gone since my stepfather started dropping hints and demonstrating his love and concern for my mom, but she was uninterested in him because all she wanted to do was concentrate on her work and me. Years later, they started dating, and now they have three children.</p>
