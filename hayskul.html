<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:20px">I finished my Highschool Grade at Justimbaste Remandaban National Highschool 
and Senior Grade at Ignacio Borbon Villamor Senior Highschool, During my Highschool days, I was able to experienced different leadership activities.
Highschool Day is a time of my academic and personal growth,Those experience has influenced my development as a person inside and outside 
of the class by making me more independent, choosing friends wisely and my past teachers encouarge me to attend in college.
I have gained my independence slowly throughout Highschool days to accomplished my those little goals of mine for myself.
The importance of being independent is being secure with who you are and what you believe in. 
It is extremely empowering knowing that you are in control of your own life and your own choices in highschool.
Gaining my independence in highschool developed me. Highschool memories will last forever.</p>
