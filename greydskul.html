<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:20px">My Gradeschool experience was fine, It is my time of learning and exploration, as I develop foundational skills in reading, writing, and math, and begin to discover my own interests and passions.Me and my classmates spend most of our day in a classroom, learning from teachers and interacting with peers through group projects and activities.My Gradeschool can be both exciting and challenging, as students adjust to new routines, expectations, and academic demands.I've experience a lot of fun and enjoyment.I'm the type of student who always been excel in every class. I am always been aquainted to join different contest such as,quizbee,jounalism,pagent,and in an athletics.
I remember when I was the contestant of our school in Little Miss Sports 2014 i felt nervous that day, but luckily I won onto that pageant.
Also, I used to join Girls scout and as far as I can remember, I am the Girls scout captain in our school. During my fifth grade I was bullied by my classmatesfor such things.I do not have several friends in our school.But,I've been always grateful in my past Elementary school for having such a wonderful experience to cherish it all the way. </p>
