My mother told me that someone special appeared into her heart.She couldn't barely imagine me with chubby little cheeks.
My newborn eyes trying to look out for what the world is made of. 
The warmth of my little heart beating faster and faster.She also said that I have adorable face looking like my dad blending with my mom's looks.
Welcome to the family, Welcome to your home sweet home, little one as my mom told.
The hospital room was bustling with activity as doctors and nurses prepared for my birth, while loved ones waited outside.
After hours of labor, My mom finally made my grand entrance into the world, crying and squirming as the medical team checked your vital signs.
My parents gazed at me in wonder, marveling at my tiny fingers and toes, and feeling an overwhelming sense of love and protectiveness.
The day I was born marked the beginning of a new chapter in my family's life, filled with new challenges, joys, and memories to cherish.</p>
